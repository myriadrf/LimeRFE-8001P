In KiCAD main window go to Preferences->Connfigure Paths
and set variable to this folder that contains the 3D models, for example:
KISYS3DMOD = d:\Lime\Projects\LMS8001\svn\PCB\LMS8001_AppPCB_1v4\KiCad_Design_files\3D_Models\

This setting is not saved with the project, it is only temporary for the session, so it has to be done each time the design is loaded.
